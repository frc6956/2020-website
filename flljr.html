    <h3>What is FIRST LEGO League Jr.?</h3>
    <p><strong>It's never too early to discover STEM.</strong> FIRST LEGO League Jr. is designed to introduce STEM
        concepts to kids ages 6 to 10
        while exciting them through a brand they know and love − LEGO®</p>
    <p>Guided by adult coaches and FIRST® Core Values, students build models using LEGO® Education WeDo 2.0 and
        create Show Me posters to present
        what they learned. The program focuses on building interest in science, technology, engineering, and math
        (STEM) through a real-world challenge
        – to be solved by research, critical thinking, and imagination.</p>

    <h3>When will the Westfield Washington FLL Jr. Teams meet?</h3>
    <p>The team will have ~18 official meetings between January 18th -
        April 1st with an end of the season banquet on a TBD date. Meeting dates will be Wednesdays from 6:00pm -
        7:00pm and Saturdays from 2:00pm - 3:30pm at Westfield High School
        unless noted as a field trip. The program will kickoff on Saturday, January 18th at Westfield High School.
    </p>
    <p>Please see the following document for a calendar of the upcoming team meetings:

            2020 Westfield Washington FLL Jr. Team Meeting Calendar</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What does it cost to join the FLL Jr. Team?</h3>
    <p>There is currently room for 12 students to be part of the two FLL Jr. teams. The teams will be mentored by
        the high school students on the Westfield High School FRC Team, SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS, along with the
        professionals that volunteer with the high school robotics team. </p>
    <p> In order to participate on the team, each elementary school student must pay $25 to cover the cost of a team
        t-shirt and sign-up to bring a small snack for the 12 students during the season. Students with parents who
        volunteer to act as coaches and attend the team meetings will have a first priority to join the team. After
        that, participation on the team will be on a first-come first-serve basis.</p>

    <h3>What is SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS?</h3>
    <p>SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS is creating a tight-knit community of passionate problem solvers that will graduate from
        high school ready to take on the world! We do this through hands-on training, community outreach, and
        intense competitions. As a FIRST Robotics Competition Team, FRC 6956 is based out of Westfield High School.
        Starting in January, students have six to eight weeks to design, build, and program a 5ft tall, 120 lb robot
        before competition. Over the “build season” students are hands-on as they learn about trade offs (speed vs.
        weight), how to CAD parts for the robot, basic tool and machining use, problem-solving, sensor uses, wiring,
        pneumatics, and programming</p>
    <p>At competitions the high school students have a short turnaround time between matches meaning they have to
        solve problems on the fly, make decisions about what should be fixed now vs. later, and learn to manage
        their adrenaline during those intense times. During a match, the team joins an alliance with two partners to
        compete head-to-head, 3 vs. 3, over a 2 minutes & 30 seconds period. Students learn to work as a team to
        score as many points as possible, developing valuable communication, teamwork, and leadership skills in the
        process. </p>
    <p>Working side-by-side professional engineers, business professionals, and teachers, students are able to see
        how their experiences on an FRC team translates to a future career in engineering, programming, business,
        teaching, and many other professional career paths. The high school students are developing their own
        mentoring skills by working with the FIRST LEGO League Junior program and mentoring the elementary school
        students. </p>

    <h3>What is the sign-up deadline to join the team?</h3>
    <p> The sign-up for the team will be due by Friday, January 10th at 6:00pm.</p>
    <p> You will receive an email confirming participation and with information about the upcoming Kickoff event no
        later then Monday, January 13th by 9:00pm (we will do our best to confirm membership as early as possible).
    </p>

    <h3>What does it take to be a coach?</h3>
    <p>We're looking for passionate parents who enjoy seeing their children develop teamwork, communication, and
        problem-solving skills. As a coach, you would be asked to prep for meetings, work with a small group of
        students to ask guided questions, and encourage the students to work together as a team! You do not need to
        know anything about robots or programming to volunteer as a coach - the high school mentors can take care of
        that!</p>
    <p> The FIRST program focuses on teaching students in K-12th grade soft and hard-skills all while having fun! We
        don't just build robots, we build students.</p>
    <p> As a coach, you would be asked to create a dashboard account via www.firstinspires.org and would sign-up as
        an official coach of the team via that form. You would need to fill out a free background check form via
        FIRST HQ and through Westfield Washington Township (the team would cover the costs of the background check).
        As a coach, you would receive a team t-shirt and your student would have a guaranteed spot on the team!</p>
    <p> Coaches would be expected to make a commitment to attend all official team meetings (Wednesdays from 6:00 -
        7:00pm and Saturday from 2:00 - 3:30pm) and communicate any potential conflicts ahead of the meeting.
        Coaches would need to prepare for approximately fifteen minutes before each team meeting to review the
        curriculum plan for that day and meet for approximately fifteen minutes after the meeting to recap with the
        other coaches and mentors. </p>
    <p> Beyond the team meetings, there will be three additional coach meetings taking place on the following dates:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Saturday, Jan 11th - COACHES ONLY Lunch/Intro Meeting 11am - Noon at Westfield High School</li>
        <li> Saturday, Feb 15th - COACHES ONLY Lunch/Touch Base Meeting 11am - Noon at Westfield High School</li>
        <li> TBD - COACHES ONLY EOY Celebration at TBD location and Day. </li>
    </ul>
